> *Welcome to our simple banking application! This banking application is a school group project in **C#** and **Postgres database**. This project made in Visual Stadio and it is a C# console application The main target user of this group project was to learn OOP in C# and learn how to make connections and talk to a database manipulating data. This project can make you to become a better developer if you are not much familier with how to talk to a databse. Becouse we have used three difrent connectiongs and much undrestandeble logics witch may help you much in future and not faceing same problem as we did during doing this project.* 


## More details:

> This project is a fully functional bank system that has been implemented in a C# console application. This bank system has Admin section where admin can create user and even admin can be the user of the banksystem also.Beside this there is a client or user section where it allows users to create accounts with different currencies, make deposits and withdrawals, transfer funds between accounts and between different users, and view account balances and with currency conversion. Bank System has a Loan section where user can take a loan about 5 times higher than their original balance. If ueser want to loan more than 5 times of original amount then loan will be denied. In Loan section user will be able to see the interest rate also.


## Features
Our dynamic bank system has several features that make it stand out:
Customizable Account Types: Our bank system allows users to create customized account types, such as 1.Savings, 2.Salary, 3.ISK, 4.Pension, 5.Family A/C, 6.Child A/C. This allows users to have greater control over their finances and better manage their money. When user will open a savings account they will be innformed about their interest rate which they will get yearly.

Flexible Transaction Options: Users can make transactions in a variety of ways, including online banking, mobile banking, and ATM transactions. Our system is designed to be flexible and convenient, allowing users to access their accounts whenever and wherever they need to. When user will transfer amount from one account to another acccount which has different cuurency, our system will convert it automatically.
Real-Time Account Balances: Our bank system provides users with real-time updates on their account balances, so they can always stay up-to-date on their financial status.For exception handling we have used TryPrase() and Try Catch().

## Features which is not completed yet:
- Our project has been done by SIMPLE INTEREST RATE. But we havn't done COMPOUND INTEREST Rate on our project.
- The user should be able to get a menu and chose if he/she wants to **transfer money** between him/her acounts or to other users acount. Beouse now your are able to this but yout dont get the menu to chose betwe

## Why this way of creating a bank system with classes and using C#, Postgres is a good ?

1 - Object-oriented design: Using classes to represent users and accounts witch are taken from the database it allows for a clear and organized structure of the system. It makes it easy to understand the different components of the system and how they relate to each other.

2 - Reusability: All classes can be reused and create multiple object of them, allowing for the representation of multiple users, accounts and transactions in the system.

3 - The use of properties with public getters and setters makes it easy to access the properties of the objects. It also makes it easy to add or remove properties in the future without affecting the rest of the system.

4 - The nested Account class within the User class is logical and easy to understand, it represents the accounts that a user has.

5 -The structure uses basic concepts of Object-oriented programming, which makes it easy to implement and understand.

## Summary:

> The project described above is designed and implemented by students of Chas Academy which is functional but not production ready solution. During the project we have performed Object oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) approach to analysis the requirements and design the application. In addition to that, we have followed agile methodologies during project work.
We have tried to build a 3-layer application by separating UI, Business logic and data access layer. Our application is built in a way that can be extend in future. There are still lot of scope available to improve in future, for example we can work with cache data to improve performance as well as data validation and security.
